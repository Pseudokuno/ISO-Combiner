This is the ISOCombine manual. The ISOCombine application is used to combine .iso files only.

Make sure to read this before continuing with the application.

	HOW TO USE:

	Before opening the application, be sure that any .iso files you would like to combine are on your
desktop or the root of your external drive. This will insure the program works efficiently.
Keep note that the program may not work on your external drive (but it won't hurt to try).

	1. Click the "Where are the ISOs?" button and select where the .iso files are (they will not appear
when selecting the file directory).

	2. Click on the "Browse" button and select at least 2 .iso files you would like to combine. If you
select an .iso that you do not want to combine, hit the "X" button next to it.

	3. Name the new combined file. This name may not include special characters nor spaces. You may add
special characters to the file directly once it has been combined.

	4. Click on "Combine ISOs" and let it do it's thing. The Command Prompt will open, but do not close
it yet. The wait time for this varies, but should not take longer that a couple of minutes (larger files may 
take longer). Once the Command Prompt says that the files have been copied, you may close the command Prompt.
If it says that 0 files were copied, try moving the location of your files to somewhere more accessible and
try again. If that still does not work then tough luck. I'm not a wizard.

	5. Once the files have been combined, feel free to close the Command prompt and do what you will with
the non-combined .iso files.

	Feel free to message me at Pseudokuno@gmail.com if you have any questions/comments. I may get to it
if I feel like it.

	I am using the "triangle.png" assest from DuckStation and am using it as the program's icon.
